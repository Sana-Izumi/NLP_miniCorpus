Some unique cooking methods use minimal oil to stir-fry or cook beef, lamb, pork, and tempura. Moreover, fermented foods provide a rich source of vitamins and minerals. Japanese minimize salt and spices by employing various condiments, herbs, and sauces in their meals.\",\n",
        "    \"Traditional Japanese diets, such as the Okinawa diet, emphasized seafood for protein and healthy fats and sweet potatoes for carbohydrates. However, the modern Japanese diet, which has taken several influences from the West and China, comprises animal proteins and several processed condiments.\",\n",
        "    \"Components of the Japanese Diet\",\n",
        "    \"Soup: Japanese diet comprises many types of soup; miso soup is the most famous. This delectable and nourishing soup contains miso, seaweed, seafood, soybean, and vegetables. Moreover, many people add noodles to the soup to make it more filling.\",\n",
        "    \"Side Dishes: Japanese side dishes include vegetables and fruits that are either sauteed, boiled, steamed, stir-fried, grilled, or pickled.\",\n",
        "    \"Main Course Meal: Japanese main course meals usually contain poultry, beef, lamb, pork, seafood, and fish with either rice or noodles seasoned with herbs and condiments.\",\n",
        "    \"Staple Food: Japanese staple food revolves around rice and noodles, particularly ramen, soba, and udon noodles. Moreover, Japanese noodles are not unhealthy; they are made of healthy whole-grain flour such as wheat (udon) and buckwheat (soba).\",\n",
        "    \"The Key Ingredients  in Japanese Foods and Their Health Benefits. Japanese foods contain a high proportion of proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, good cholesterol, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Moreover, there is a limited portion of carbohydrates and sodium, which is why the incidence of cardiac diseases in Japan is the least.\",\n",
        "    \"Fish and Seafood. Famous kinds of fish in Japanese meals are tuna, salmon, mackerel, and pacific saury. Moreover, seafood varieties include uni (sea urchin), shrimp, unagi (eel), scallops, squid, and octopus. These foods contain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B2, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, iodine, and zinc.\",\n",
        "    \"Omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA are highly beneficial for the vitality of the heart and brain health. They prevent cardiac and cerebral issues like heart attack and stroke. Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids are excellent for reducing inflammation and depression and improving temporary memory problems (dementia).\",\n",
        "    \"Plant-based Products (Fruits, Vegetables, Tofu, Natto, and Seaweed). Popular Japanese fruits include persimmon, mandarin, fig, kiwi, sudachi, yuzu, kumquat, peach, plum, grapes, melon, pear, and apple. These fruits are rich in antioxidants to help fight against free radicals and vitamins C, A, B, and E, required for the normal functioning of the human body. Japanese consume these fruits as snacks, for breakfast, as side dishes, and for desserts which they consume much less.\",\n",
        "    \"Japanese side dishes and main course meals comprise a lot of nutritious vegetables like onions, scallions, daikon radishes, carrots, sweet potatoes, and sweet corn. Moreover, they prepare these veggies by either boiling, steaming, grilling, pickling, or stir-frying using minimal oil. These plant-based foods are rich in vitamins and minerals and provide a good source of carbohydrates and dietary fiber. This insoluble fiber is a superfood for gut health. It is a lubricant to soften stool and prevent constipation, the mother of diseases.\",\n",
        "    \"Tofu, the soybean curd, is a rich protein and dietary fiber source. It is a gluten-free and low-calorie food excellent for colonic health (colon- part of the digestive system). It also prevents the risk of colonic cancers and IBS/IBD (inflammatory bowel syndrome/disease).\",\n",
        "    \"Another soybean product, natto, is the result of the fermentation of soybeans and is packed with proteins and probiotics. Furthermore, seaweed is quite popular in Japanese meals; it is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, particularly iodine. Seaweed is a fantastic food for normal thyroid functioning.\",\n",
        "    \"Animal Proteins (Beef, Lamb, Pork, and Poultry). Beef, lamb, pork, and poultry are rich sources of proteins; one should still prefer poultry and fish to red meat. Red meat is high in cholesterol and can increase the risk of heart attacks, coronary artery diseases, and strokes. It is why the Japanese prefer fish, seafood, and plant-based proteins over animal ones. In short, you can take red meat with caution (limited portion and often).\",\n",
        "    \"Good Fats and Unsaturated Vegetable Oils. Japanese use good fats and unsaturated oils for cooking. About 81% of Japanese use olive oil and sesame oil due to the plethora of health benefits. These oils are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. They prevent heart diseases and diabetes, regulate cholesterol levels, and assist in losing body weight.\",\n",
        "    \"Japonica rice and Japanese Noodles. Japanese rice and noodles make up a significant portion of their carbohydrate intake. They use white short-grain rice for dishes such as donburi, sushi, Tai-meshi, battera, and tokaraisu. However, Japanese noodles such as udon and soba are made of wheat and buckwheat, containing all essential nutrients.\",\n",
        "    \"Japanese Fermented Food. Japanese prefer fermented foods as condiments over spices and salt to keep them healthy and fit. These include natto, miso, shoyu, umeboshi, katsuobushi, and tsukemono. Moreover, these fermented foods are rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\",\n",
        "    \"Green Teas. Popular Japanese green teas are matcha, sencha, genmaicha, bancha, gyokuro, tencha, and hojicha. These antioxidants help fight free radicals, prevent aging, and prolong a healthy lifespan.\",\n",
        "    \"What Type of Foods Do Japanese Take In Moderation? Japanese limit the use of dairy products, red meat, eggs, bakery goods, and sugary foods to keep them healthy since these foods contain a high proportion of simple carbs and sugars.\",\n",
        "    \"Why Is the Japanese Diet So Healthy? Japanese diet mainly relies on plants and seafood for proteins,  good fats, vitamins, and minerals.

        "    \"I was born and raised in the American Midwest, but love visiting my parents' homeland in Japan. Central to every trip there is always the food: Oh my goodness, the food.\",\n",
        "    \"Eating is a raging national obsession here, with good reason. Staggering varieties of food are available everywhere; it's all delicious and — most impressively, to me — always fresh.\",\n",
        "    \"Soba noodles come made to order, with flash-fried seasonal tempura vegetables. Mouthwatering sushi and curry rice lunches are sold on train platforms. You can wander past cases of specialty foods, from marbled meats to miso-pickled vegetables to handmade gyoza dumplings, in the depa chicka, or department store basements.\",\n",
        "    \"There's a slavish devotion to the gourmet that might seem crazy anywhere else. In summer months, domestic peaches come boxed in cushions to protect flesh as delicate as a baby's cheek.\",\n",
        "    \"What's remarkable about Japan is that food like this is available almost everywhere you turn, yet obesity is not the public health threat it is in the U.S.\",\n",

        "    \"I ask Terry Huang, a health policy professor at the City University of New York, about the apparent contradiction in Japan's relationship with food. He says there are various reasons, most of which are rooted in Japan's cultural history. He says Japan — and Asian countries generally — place greater emphasis on health and longevity, as compared to convenience, say, or instant gratification.\",\n",
        "    \"Traditional Japanese cuisine centers around vegetables, soy products like miso, and seaweed or seafood, making it naturally high in fiber and good fats.\",\n",
        "    \"'It may be hard to quantify, but qualitatively it's important because it influences much of how we design our communities, how we think about food, how we engage in lifestyle behaviors in general,' he says.\",\n",
        "    \"In other words, the fundamental construct of life in Japan makes it easier to live healthier. Huang calls this 'default design' and he says it literally comes built in: The fact that Japanese cities are densely populated, but safe, allows for heavy reliance on public transport, for example. And populations that use public transport tend to walk more and get more exercise just by virtue of that design.\",\n",
        "    \"My 74-year-old mother tells me errands are her primary form of exercise; the incidental walking from doing chores and shopping naturally adds up. I documented that during my trip: I spent eight days shadowing my parents, who live in central Tokyo, and my Apple watch fitness tracker showed I walked an average of over 6 miles a day, which is 60% more than I typically do living in the suburbs.\",\n",
        "    \"Public transportation is widely available in Japan and it increases physical activity, compared to commuting by car\",\n",
        "    \"Japanese cities are built around public transportation, which encourages more movement, and increases exercise across the population.\",\n",
        "    \"That's why default design is so powerful. It bakes healthy habits into daily life. Huang says that's critical because otherwise healthy behavior becomes less automatic, and more dependent on individual effort. 'Any time you add additional burden in planning for a healthy meal or going to exercise, that's going to translate into a lower likelihood of people actually engaging,' he says.\",\n",
        "    \"I realized that's true even when it comes to food; Japan has a kind of default design that supports healthier eating. It stems from a traditional diet that leans heavily on vegetables, seaweed and seafood. But it also is embedded into the culture of eating there, Huang says.\",\n",
        "    \"'Culturally, when it comes to food, there is a stronger emphasis on quality and refinement in the preparation of each dish as opposed to quantity,' he says.\",\n",
        "    \"It's true even for things the Japanese consider fast food, like one of the Tokyo ramen stalls I ducked into with my mother on a recent visit.\",\n",
        "    \"Across the serving counter, we watched the chef draw broth from fish flakes and pork bones. He ladled the soup onto noodles and a thin slice of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, topped off with nori, or seaweed. The result was savory, nourishing, and cost less than $5.\",\n",
        "    \"I think my favorite example that shows the contrast with the U.S. is Japanese convenience store food. There is no market for supersized slushies here, or day-old hot dogs cooked on rollers. Japanese convenience stories, called conbini, feature refrigerated walls of noodle salads, rice balls, bento boxes, all perfectly portioned and delicious, if you ask me.\",\n",
        "    \"Again, there's an adherence to freshness: Instead of using preservatives and stabilizers as so much processed food in the U.S. does, manufactures print sell-by labels on each package that are time-stamped to the minute. Unsold wares are tracked and swapped out multiple times a day.\",\n",
        "    \"This is not to say Japan is immune to industrialized and ultra-processed food trends driving up obesity rates worldwide. Excess weight is a growing concern here, too. Yet the population is remarkably resilient in the face of that global trend.\",\n",
        "    \"Why? One key factor my mom reminds me of — and many researchers point to — is the Japanese school lunch. It is free, scratch-made and balanced, but that isn't all. Starting in elementary school, lunchtime itself is treated like a class in nutrition, says Michiko Tomioka, a Japanese nutritionist based in New Jersey. Kids serve each other food, help with clean up, and are encouraged to eat everything they're given.\",\n",
        "    \"This lunchtime ritual establishes a common cultural understanding about what healthy eating looks like. Tomioka says. And that's how it also becomes a habit that endures.\",\n",
        "    \"I often think how revolutionary it would be for my life raising two teenage sons, if I had a Japanese conbini within walking distance from my house in suburban Washington DC. Most days, I try to adhere to a Japanese approach to food, which is actually an almost impossible commitment to keep, especially as a working solo parent.\",\n",
        "    \"It means driving, regularly, to half a dozen different grocery or specialty stores to stock fresh ingredients, like shrimp, dried seaweed (nori), or produce like Japanese yams and chives, then setting aside time throughout the day to wash, chop, cook and clean. (I also keep a small garden.) There is no other option I know of yet that meets my three golden criteria — healthy, economical and delicious.\",\n",
        "    \"I'm prone to griping: Why must eating fresh require taking on what feels like a second or third job? Many parent friends of mine seem to regard my efforts as laudable, maybe, but lunatic.\",\n",
        "    \"The reality is, I'm extremely lucky; there are so many privileges implicit in being able to prioritize fresh eating or healthy living in America. Modern life affords few families the time, money or access to the kinds of things I'm able to do (at least sometimes).\",\n",
        "    \"In three years covering health, I've come to understand how so many of the health problems in America stem from inequities that begin, at core, with what we grew up eating and the lifestyle we lived. So I also wonder how much better off we might be, as a population, if living or eating well wasn't a burden we placed on individuals, but something our society supported — by design.\",\n",
        "    \"Not only do the Japanese have a high average life expectancy, but they also have some of the healthiest, most independent long-lived people in the world. Once could say that this longevity is backed by the Japanese diet, while takes advantage of the rich variety of ingredients found in the seas, mountains, and fields of Japan.\",\n",

However, it is reported that second-generation Japanese raised in Hawaii develop this condition earlier in life, and by the third generation, the difference to Caucasian people almost completely vanishes. Research into the rates of cancer development also show that from the second generation, there is a greater number of sufferers. It is speculated that this is because unlike their parents’ generation, the children and grandchildren of those immigrants have synchronized to the dietary lifestyles of where they live.\",\n",
        "    \"In the case of Americans of Japanese descent, cancer rates increased, and in Brazil, the switch to a meat-focused diet saw an increase in incidence of heart attacks, with statistics showing at least a 10-year drop in average life expectancy.\",\n",
        "    \"As there are multiple research reports showing that the adoption of Western dietary habits by immigrants of Japanese descent increases the rate of lifestyle diseases and shortens life expectancy, people have come to believe that Japanese diets are more healthy and lead to longer lives.\",\n",
        "    \"The mother’s milk of mammals contains lactose. Baby mammals break down this lactose into glucose and galactose to absorb it, using a catabolic enzyme called lactase. However, after the weaning period, they lose the ability to secrete lactase within the body, and become unable to break down lactose. This is why a considerable number of Japanese suffer effects such as diarrhea or upset stomachs as a result of drinking milk.\",\n",
        "    \"However, Europeans continue to be able to secrete lactase within the body even as adults.
